# Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized hub for storing my notebooks, answers, and learning progress from the [ARENA (AI Risk and Evaluation Network for Alignment)](https://www.arena.education/) program. ARENA is a structured, community-driven initiative designed to provide a guided path into technical AI safety research, focusing on areas like interpretability, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and evaluations.  

The program builds on foundational open-source resources such as Anthropic's transformer circuits, Neel Nanda's TransformerLens library, and the original MLAB material, offering curated content and a supportive community for those looking to dive deeper into AI safety.  

# Content

The material in this repository covers the first five days of the ARENA curriculum. It provides a grounding in all the fundamentals necessary to complete the more advanced sections of the course, such as reinforcement learning (RL), transformers, mechanistic interpretability, and generative models.  

### Highlights from this chapter include:  
- **Building your own 1D and 2D convolution functions**  
- **Building and loading weights into a Residual Neural Network (ResNet), and finetuning it on a classification task**  
- **Working with weights and biases to optimize hyperparameters**  
- **Implementing your own backpropagation mechanism**  
- **Building your own Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) & Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and using them to generate images**  

In this repo, you'll find:  
- **Notebooks:** Code implementations, experiments, and explorations of technical AI safety concepts.  
- **Answers:** Solutions and reflections on ARENA exercises and challenges.  
- **Learning Resources:** Summaries, notes, and additional resources I've found helpful during my journey.  

*Inspired by the ARENA community and its mission to make technical AI safety research accessible and actionable.*
